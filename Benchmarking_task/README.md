# **Comparative Analysis of SMiTH Model on Favites Datasets**  

In this directory, we present a **comparative analysis** of the **SMiTH model** results on two simulated datasets: **Favites_log** and **Favites_exp**. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of **SMiTH** in reconstructing transmission networks compared to other models.


## **Comparison Overview**
### **1. SMiTH Model on Favites_log**  
We compared the **SMiTH model** results on the **Favites_log** dataset against the following transmission network inference models:  
- **Cassiopeia**  
- **Machina**  
- **Phyloscanner**  
- **STraTUS**  
- **TNet**  

### **2. SMiTH Model on Favites_exp**  
For the **Favites_exp** dataset, we compared the **SMiTH model** results with:  
- **TransPhyloMulti**  


## **Directory Structure & Contents**
Each **model-specific directory** contains:  
ðŸ“‚ **`/model_name/`** â€” A subdirectory for each model comparison, including:  
- **`run_model.sh` / `run_model.py`** â€” Code or scripts used to run the model on the dataset.  
- **Evaluation scripts** â€” Methods for analyzing the modelâ€™s performance.  
- **Results files** â€” Output transmission networks generated by each model.  
- **Performance metrics** â€” Comparison against the **true transmission network** from the Favites method using:  
  - **Specificity** (True Negative Rate)  
  - **Sensitivity** (Recall)  
  - **F1-score** (Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall)  


## **How to Use This Repository**
### **Navigate to the Model Directory**
Each model has its own folder where you can find scripts and evaluation files.  

### **Run the Model**
Follow the provided scripts and instructions to **replicate the execution** of the model on the dataset.
