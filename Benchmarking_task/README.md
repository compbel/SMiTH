# **Comparative Analysis of SMiTH Model on Favites Datasets**  

In this directory, we present a **comparative analysis** of the **SMiTH model** results on two simulated datasets: **Favites_log** and **Favites_exp**. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of **SMiTH** in reconstructing transmission networks compared to other models.

## **Simulated Datasets**
This section provides details about the simulated datasets used in our analysis. These datasets were generated using the Favites method to simulate transmission networks and phylogenies under controlled conditions.

The [Favites_log](https://uconn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pavel_skums_uconn_edu/EkBG6Wu6y1dGpZFsFfWgJmUBaLBqtF6eRCBjlLW_BH-x1A?e=6wYFKX) and [Favites_exp](https://uconn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/marykafi_uconn_edu/Documents/Favites_exp.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=weFZX5) datasets are available for download. Favites datasets both simulate disease transmission and viral evolution using a Barabási-Albert contact network with 100 nodes and the Generalized Epidemic Modeling Framework (GEMF). Both datasets generate phylogenetic trees using VirusTreeSimulator and model sequence evolution under a GTR+Gamma framework, incorporating realistic mutation rates and rate heterogeneity.

Key Differences Between Favites_log and Favites_exp:
- Favites_log: Uses a logistic growth model, leading to a slower initial spread that plateaus over time.
- Favites_exp: Uses an exponential growth model, resulting in faster outbreak expansion with continuous acceleration.
- Favites_exp has a higher mutation rate (tree_mutation_rate: 0.2 vs. 0.01 in Favites_log), introducing more genetic variation.
- Favites_exp uses edge-weighted seed selection, favoring well-connected nodes for initial infections, whereas Favites_log uses random seed selection.

These datasets allow for comparative evaluation of transmission network inference models under different outbreak dynamics, providing insight into how growth patterns impact phylogenetic structures and transmission reconstruction accuracy.
